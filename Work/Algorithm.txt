Algorithm:

1. Decision Tree Classifier:
   - Decision trees are a popular supervised learning method used for classification and regression tasks.
   - In this code, `DecisionTreeClassifier` from scikit-learn is utilized to build a decision tree model. Decision trees split the data into subsets based on the most significant attributes at each node, leading to a tree-like structure where leaf nodes represent the class labels (in this case, disease prognosis).

2. Support Vector Machine (SVM):
   - SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
   - In this code, `SVC` (Support Vector Classifier) from scikit-learn is employed. SVM tries to find the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space. It's effective in high-dimensional spaces and suitable for cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.

These algorithms are trained on the provided training data to learn the relationship between symptoms and disease prognosis, enabling the system to make predictions for unseen data (test cases) based on the learned patterns. Additionally, cross-validation is performed to evaluate the models' performance and ensure generalization to unseen data.
